        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
         <p>I am a student in web development who loves to explore and build new projects. I am passionate about learning and being able to create something from scratch. I enjoy being able to create a website or app that I can show off to my friends and family. I have a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have been able to create basic websites and apps. <br><br>I am currently learning more advanced topics such as React and Node.js, and I am excited to use them to create more complex projects. I am also passionate about teaching others how to code and I enjoy helping out those who are just starting out in web development. I am eager to continue learning and to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can create with web development. </p>
